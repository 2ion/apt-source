apt-source - CLI for manipulating APT package sources
Copyright (C) 2014 Jens Oliver John <dev@2ion.de>

Usage:
  apt-source <command> [options] [--] <APT source files>
  Any command and set of options will be separateply
  applied to each APT source file in the file list.

Commands:
  --select, -S
      Select source entries using the criteria in the
      query table. The source file will be re-written
      using only the selected entries unless --stdout
      is present.
  --modify, -M
      Select source entries using the criteria in the
      query table and modify them using the specific-
      ation in the change table. The changes will be
      written to the source file unless --stdout is
      present.
  --clean, -C
      Parse the source file and re-write it without
      changing anything. Overwrites the source file
      unless --stdout is present.

Options:
  --query-table QT, -q QT
      A Lua table with key-value pairs by which source
      entries will be selected. The table is to be
      written without the outer curly braces and may
      have the keys uri, suite, active, components. The
      values of these keys may be tables in which case
      the query will be OR'd, ie. at least one element
      in the list must match for a source entry to be
      selected.
  --change-table CT, -c CT
      Like --query-table, but specifies the changes to
      be applied to a source entry.
  --stdout, -r
      For commands that would overwrite a source file,
      write to stdout instead. (Read-only mode).
  --help, -h
      Output this message and exit.
  --version, -v
      Output the program version and exit.

Please refer to the man page for details and usage examples.
